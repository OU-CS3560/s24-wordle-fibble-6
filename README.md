# Team Name: Yorm

This project will closely follow the design and implementation of the game nerdle (https://nerdlegame.com). The player/user will attempt to guess an equation that is 8 symbols/numbers long. The possible operations that cna be preformed in this equation are multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. The player has a total of 6 guesses to figure out the predetermined equation. Each element of the equation will be highlighted either grey, yellow, or green. Green means you have the correct position for the element, yellow means the element is in the equation but not at that position, and grey means that element is not in the equation.

## About this project


## Platform

Node.js: This will be the language we use for the backend

Typescript: This is where the logical functions wll be made

SQLite(possibly)- This database will hold a list of randomly generated equations that the user has to solve for

## Frameworks/Tools

Notion: This software will be used to keep track of progress and help assign tasks to different team members.

Angular Cli: This platform will help build the single page application that will hold the nerdle game. This framework will help automate tasks like project setup, code generation: testing and deployment.

Github Pages: This will be where we host the site, this a free and easily accessable site for people to interact with the site.

Figma: This platoform will be used to showcase the User interface of the project so we can better visualize the end project and how to set up the front end components of the project
